  - Focuses on actual threats without unverifiable claims
  - More honest positioning about ecosystem risks

### Technical Notes
- Added `isLegitimateHighEntropyString()` function with pattern matching for known formats
- Base64 detection now requires padding or >100 char length to avoid flagging random strings
- All existing test fixtures still pass (no regressions)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Fixed CI failures on acidtest repository
  - Workflows now use local build (`npm install && npm run build`) when running on acidtest repo
  - Only scans PASS fixtures (`fixture-pass`, `fixture-mcp-pass`) in CI
  - Test fixtures designed to fail (fixture-fail, fixture-danger) no longer cause CI failures
  - Workflows still function correctly as templates for user repositories (use `npx acidtest@latest`)

### Changed
- Workflows build from source when detecting acidtest repository
- CI tests validate scanner works correctly without falsely failing on test cases

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **JSON Error Handling**: When `--json` flag is used, errors now output valid JSON instead of stderr messages
  - Errors now return structured JSON: `{"status": "ERROR", "error": "message", ...}`
  - Fixes GitHub Actions workflows failing silently when no SKILL.md/MCP manifest found
  - Improves integration with CI/CD pipelines and programmatic usage
- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Templates now work correctly on acidtest repository itself
  - Auto-detects acidtest repo and scans `test-fixtures` instead of root directory
  - Handles ERROR status properly in all workflow examples
  - Prevents workflow failures when running on the acidtest repository
  - Still functions correctly as templates for users to copy to their skill/MCP repos

### Changed
- Error output format when using `--json` flag is now consistent with scan results
- GitHub Actions workflows now serve dual purpose: testing acidtest + user templates

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: CI/CD workflow templates for automated security scanning
  - `.github/workflows/acidtest-template.yml` - Production-ready template for copying to skill repos

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Entropy-based Obfuscation Detection**: Shannon entropy analysis for string literals
  - Automatically calculates entropy for all string literals in code
  - Flags strings with entropy >4.5 as potential obfuscation (MEDIUM severity)
  - Smart filtering: skips URLs and short strings (<20 chars) to avoid false positives
  - Detects base64-encoded payloads, random character sequences, and encoded commands
  - Example detection: Base64 strings, hex-encoded data, minified obfuscated code
- Test fixture for entropy detection (`test-fixtures/fixture-entropy/`)

### Technical Details
- Shannon entropy formula: -Σ(p × log₂(p)) where p is character frequency
- Threshold: 4.5 (empirically determined to balance detection vs false positives)
- Minimum string length: 20 characters (shorter strings naturally have lower entropy)
- Implementation: AST-based analysis using TypeScript Compiler API

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **New Attack Patterns**: 5 new detection patterns for broader threat coverage
  - `di-010`: npm/yarn/pnpm install in code (HIGH) - detects runtime package installation
  - `di-011`: git clone/pull/fetch operations (HIGH) - detects repository cloning attempts
  - `ex-007`: Reverse shell patterns (CRITICAL) - detects reverse shell commands (nc -e, /dev/tcp/, bash -i, socat)
  - `ex-008`: DNS lookup functions (MEDIUM) - detects potential DNS exfiltration
  - `ob-006`: Hex decoding (MEDIUM) - detects hex-based obfuscation techniques
- **Enhanced File Discovery**: Expanded ignore patterns to skip irrelevant files
  - Added `coverage/` - test coverage output directories
  - Added `*.min.js` and `*.min.mjs` - minified files (likely third-party)
  - Added `vendor/` - third-party vendor code
- **Documentation**: Added CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md provides clear guidelines for adding detection patterns
  - SECURITY.md establishes vulnerability reporting process and scope
  - Both files improve project professionalism and community engagement

### Fixed
- **Finding Deduplication**: Capped repeated pattern matches at 3 deductions per unique pattern
  - Prevents unfair score inflation when the same pattern triggers many times
  - Example: 50 fetch() calls now deduct 24 points (3 × 8) instead of 400 points (50 × 8)
  - More accurate risk assessment for skills with repetitive patterns

### Changed
- Pattern count: 43 → 48 detection patterns
- File scanning now excludes coverage reports, minified files, and vendor directories
