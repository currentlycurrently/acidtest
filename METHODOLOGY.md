# AcidTest Security Methodology

This document provides transparency about AcidTest's detection capabilities, limitations, and the security threats it addresses.

## What AcidTest Does

AcidTest performs **static analysis** on AI agent skills and MCP servers using four complementary layers:

1. **Permission Analysis** - Audits declared permissions in YAML frontmatter
2. **Injection Detection** - Scans markdown for prompt injection patterns
3. **Code Analysis** - AST and regex-based scanning of JavaScript/TypeScript
4. **Cross-Reference** - Validates permissions match actual behavior

### Detection Capabilities

**What We Catch Well (~85-90% success rate):**
- Direct calls to dangerous APIs (`exec`, `eval`, `Function`)
- Common prompt injection patterns
- Hardcoded credentials and API keys
- Data exfiltration to undeclared domains
- Standard obfuscation techniques (base64, hex encoding)
- Dynamic requires with variables or computed values
- String concatenation bypasses: `require('child_' + 'process')`
- Template literal bypasses: `` require(`mod_${name}`) ``
- Property access bypasses: `global['child_process']`
- Function constructor abuse: `new Function('return eval')()`
- Undeclared network calls
- Suspicious file system operations

**What We May Miss (<10-15% of sophisticated attacks):**
- Advanced control flow obfuscation (multi-step indirection)
- Encrypted or polymorphic payloads
- Time-delayed execution
- Data leaks via timing side channels
- Unicode homograph attacks
- Behavioral analysis (runtime-only detection)
- Supply chain attacks (dependency vulnerabilities)
- Zero-day exploitation techniques

## How Static Analysis Works

### Strengths

1. **Zero Runtime Overhead** - Scans code before execution, no sandboxing needed
2. **Fast** - Completes in seconds, suitable for CI/CD pipelines
3. **Deterministic** - Same code always produces same results
4. **No Network Required** - Works offline, no API keys needed
5. **Language-Aware** - Uses TypeScript compiler API for AST analysis

### Limitations

1. **Cannot Execute Code** - Cannot detect behavior that emerges only at runtime
2. **Limited Context** - Cannot track complex dataflows across files
3. **Bypass Potential** - Determined attackers can evade pattern-based detection
4. **False Positives** - Legitimate code may trigger security warnings
5. **No Dependency Analysis** - Does not scan npm packages or transitive dependencies

## Known Bypass Techniques

While we've implemented mitigations for common bypasses, sophisticated attackers may use:

### Detected Bypasses

✅ **String Concatenation**
```javascript
require('child_' + 'process')  // CAUGHT by AST-based detection
```

✅ **Template Literals**
```javascript
const mod = `child_${x}`;
require(mod);  // CAUGHT as dynamic require
```

✅ **Property Access**
```javascript
global['child_process']  // CAUGHT by bracket notation detection
```

✅ **Function Constructor**
```javascript
new Function('return eval')()  // CAUGHT by AST pattern matching
```

### Potentially Missed Bypasses

⚠️ **Multi-Step Indirection**
```javascript
const getModule = () => 'child_' + 'process';
setTimeout(() => require(getModule()), 1000);  // May evade detection
```

⚠️ **WebAssembly Execution**
```javascript
const wasm = await WebAssembly.instantiate(buffer);  // Not analyzed
```

⚠️ **External Code Loading**
```javascript
const remote = await fetch(url).then(r => r.text());
eval(remote);  // eval() caught, but remote source not analyzed
```

## When to Use AcidTest

### Good Use Cases

✅ **Pre-Installation Screening** - Quick security check before installing skills
✅ **CI/CD Integration** - Automated scanning in pull request workflows
✅ **Bulk Auditing** - Scan entire directories of skills/servers
✅ **Trust Score Comparison** - Compare security profiles of similar tools
✅ **Education** - Learn about common attack patterns in AI agent code

### Not Recommended For

❌ **Production Security** - Should not be your only defense
❌ **Compliance Certification** - Not a substitute for professional security audits
❌ **Malware Forensics** - Not designed for analyzing known malicious code
❌ **Dependency Vulnerabilities** - Use `npm audit` for package CVEs
❌ **Runtime Protection** - Does not sandbox or monitor execution

## Threat Model

### In-Scope Threats

1. **Malicious Skills** - Deliberately crafted to exfiltrate data or execute commands
2. **Backdoored Tools** - Legitimate-looking skills with hidden malicious code
3. **Prompt Injection** - Attempts to manipulate AI agent behavior via markdown
4. **Credential Theft** - Harvesting API keys, tokens, environment variables
5. **Privilege Escalation** - Undeclared file system or network access

### Out-of-Scope Threats

1. **Supply Chain Attacks** - Compromised npm dependencies (use `npm audit`)
2. **Zero-Day Exploits** - Unknown vulnerabilities in Node.js or libraries
3. **Social Engineering** - Tricking users into approving malicious prompts
4. **Physical Access** - Adversary with direct access to the system
5. **Advanced Persistent Threats** - Nation-state level sophistication

## Scoring Methodology

AcidTest uses a **100-point trust score** system:

### Score Calculation

- **Start:** 100 points
- **Deductions:** Based on severity of findings
  - CRITICAL: -25 points (eval, data exfiltration)
  - HIGH: -15 points (dynamic require, dangerous imports)
  - MEDIUM: -8 points (obfuscation, suspicious patterns)
  - LOW: -3 points (info leaks, minor issues)
  - INFO: 0 points (informational findings)
- **Capping:** Max 3 deductions per unique pattern (prevents score inflation)
- **Floor:** Score cannot go below 0

### Status Thresholds

| Score Range | Status  | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 80-100      | PASS    | Safe to install with review of findings |
| 50-79       | WARN    | Review recommended, some concerns |
| 20-49       | FAIL    | Not recommended, significant issues |
| 0-19        | DANGER  | Do not install, critical vulnerabilities |

### Scoring Limitations

- **Subjective Weights:** Severity levels are based on common threat models, not scientific measurement
- **Context-Free:** Same pattern penalized equally regardless of context
- **Binary Detection:** No severity gradation within a category
- **No Risk Aggregation:** Multiple LOW findings don't escalate to HIGH

## Recommendations for Users

### Before Installing a Skill

1. **Run AcidTest:** `npx acidtest scan ./skill-directory`
2. **Review Findings:** Read each security warning, don't just check the score
3. **Check Permissions:** Ensure declared permissions match your expectations
4. **Inspect Code:** For WARN/FAIL/DANGER, manually review the code
5. **Test in Sandbox:** Run untrusted skills in isolated environments

### For Skill Developers

1. **Declare Permissions:** Be explicit about env vars, file paths, network access
2. **Avoid Dynamic Imports:** Use static `require()` and `import` statements
3. **Document Intent:** Add code comments explaining any low-level API usage
4. **Test with AcidTest:** Ensure `npx acidtest scan .` returns PASS before publishing
5. **CI/CD Integration:** Add AcidTest to GitHub Actions to prevent regressions

### For Organizations

1. **Threshold Policy:** Reject skills below a certain score (e.g., FAIL or worse)
2. **Manual Review:** Require human approval for WARN status
3. **Allowlist:** Maintain approved skills that passed security review
4. **Private Registry:** Host audited skills internally
5. **Least Privilege:** Run agent skills with minimal system permissions

## Continuous Improvement

AcidTest's detection patterns are continuously updated based on:

- Observed attack techniques in the wild
- Community contributions via GitHub issues/PRs
- Security research publications
- Feedback from production deployments

**Current pattern count:** 79 detection patterns
- 48 TypeScript/JavaScript patterns across 6 categories
- 31 Python patterns (17 imports, 14 dangerous calls)

**See:** [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to submit new patterns.

- No regressions in TypeScript detection

Python support is production-ready as of v1.0.0 Phase 2.

## Comparison to Other Tools

| Tool Type | AcidTest | npm audit | Sandbox/VM | Manual Review |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Speed | ⚡ Fast (seconds) | Fast | Slow | Very Slow |
| Coverage | Code + Config | Dependencies | Runtime | Comprehensive |
| False Positives | Some | Few | Rare | None |
| Setup | Zero config | Built-in | Complex | N/A |
| Bypass Resistance | Medium | High | High | Very High |

**Recommendation:** Use AcidTest as **first-line defense**, not replacement for defense-in-depth.

## Transparency & Honesty

We believe security tools should be honest about their limitations:

- **Not foolproof:** Determined attackers can bypass static analysis
- **Not comprehensive:** Does not replace professional security audits
- **Not certified:** Not suitable for compliance requirements
- **Not runtime protection:** Does not prevent execution of malicious code

**AcidTest is best used as a fast, automated screening tool in a layered security strategy.**
